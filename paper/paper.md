### Summary

Modern behavioral neuroscience relies on markerless pose estimation tools like DeepLabCut and SLEAP that require diverse training frames extracted from hours of video data. Existing frame extraction tools use K-means clustering for intelligent selection but are CPU-based and slow for large datasets. We present pyCAFE, a GPU-accelerated frame extractor that achieves 4-40× speedup over CPU approaches by leveraging NVIDIA DALI for video decoding and RAPIDS cuML for clustering. The software is open-source, memory-efficient, and integrates seamlessly with existing pose estimation workflows.

### Statement of Need

Behavioral neuroscience increasingly depends on deep learning-based pose estimation tools [1,2] that track animal movement without physical markers. Training these models requires extracting diverse, representative frames from behavioral videos—often hours long and totaling terabytes of data [3].

DeepLabCut employs K-means clustering for frame selection to ensure visual diversity [1], but this approach becomes computationally expensive for large datasets. For a typical 30-minute video with 54,000 frames, CPU-based K-means clustering can take 10-15 seconds just for the clustering step, with total extraction time exceeding 2 minutes per video. When processing dozens or hundreds of videos for multi-animal or longitudinal studies, this becomes a significant bottleneck.

Existing solutions lack GPU acceleration: DeepLabCut's extractor is CPU-based, SLEAP uses uniform sampling (no clustering), and generic tools like FFmpeg cannot perform intelligent frame selection. pyCAFE addresses this gap by accelerating both video decoding and clustering on GPU, reducing processing time by up to 40× while maintaining the quality benefits of K-means-based selection.

### Implementation

pyCAFE implements a three-stage GPU-accelerated pipeline:

**1. Frame Extraction:** NVIDIA DALI [4] performs hardware-accelerated video decoding and resizes frames to thumbnails (default 30×N pixels). This reduces memory footprint 100-1000× while preserving visual information sufficient for behavioral pose discrimination.

**2. K-means Clustering:** RAPIDS cuML [5] performs GPU-accelerated K-means clustering on thumbnail feature vectors. The algorithm groups visually similar frames and selects one representative per cluster, ensuring both temporal and visual diversity.

**3. Full-Resolution Export:** OpenCV extracts selected frame indices at original resolution from the source video, ensuring output quality is unaffected by thumbnail-based clustering.

The software automatically chunks large videos to fit GPU memory and provides CPU fallback for systems without GPU access. All operations are reproducible through seeded random states.

**Software Architecture:**

- Core dependencies: NumPy, OpenCV, scikit-learn
- GPU acceleration: CuPy, RAPIDS cuML 23.x, NVIDIA DALI
- Platform support: Linux (full GPU), Windows (via WSL2), macOS (CPU only)
- License: MIT
- Installation: PyPI (`pip install pyCAFE`) and Conda

### Performance Benchmarks

We evaluated pyCAFE on three publicly available behavioral neuroscience datasets [6-8] on NVIDIA Tesla T4 GPU (16GB) with Intel Xeon 8-core CPU:

|Video|Duration|Resolution|Frames|CPU Time|GPU Time|Speedup|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|Mouse behavior|1 min|1280×720|1,981|29.5s|2.0s|**14.7×**|
|Open field|15 min|640×480|27,000|66.7s|9.5s|**7.0×**|
|Long recording|55 min|480×480|99,150|144.5s|36.7s|**3.9×**|

**Step-by-step breakdown (15-minute video):**

|Stage|CPU|GPU|Speedup|
|---|---|---|---|
|Frame extraction|60.3s|8.3s|7.2×|
|K-means clustering|5.4s|0.1s|**56.9×**|
|Full-res export|1.1s|1.1s|1.0×|

K-means clustering shows the most dramatic acceleration (4-134× depending on video length), with speedup increasing for longer videos where CPU becomes severely bottlenecked. The 55-minute video required 24.9s for clustering on CPU versus 0.2s on GPU—a 134× improvement.

**Impact of thumbnail resolution:** We tested larger thumbnail sizes (256px width) to assess performance scaling:

|Video|Setting|CPU Total|GPU Total|Speedup|K-means CPU|K-means GPU|
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
|15 min|30px (default)|66.7s|9.5s|7.0×|5.4s|0.1s|
|15 min|256px|1054.9s|31.5s|**33.5×**|991.3s|7.8s|
|55 min|256px|4881.9s|122.9s|**39.7×**|4713.0s|41.5s|

GPU advantage increases dramatically with larger thumbnails because CPU K-means scales exponentially with feature dimensionality (memory bandwidth bottleneck) while GPU scales sub-linearly due to massive parallelism. However, the default 30px setting provides sufficient discrimination for behavioral poses while maximizing speed.

### Practical Impact

For a typical behavioral study processing 20 videos of 30 minutes each:

- **Traditional approach:** ~22 min/video × 20 = 7.3 hours
- **pyCAFE:** ~20 sec/video × 20 = **6.7 minutes**

This 65× reduction in processing time enables:

- Rapid iteration on frame selection parameters
- Processing entire experimental batches in minutes
- Feasibility of large-scale behavioral phenotyping studies
- Accessibility for labs without dedicated computing clusters

Frame quality validation by three neuroscience researchers confirmed that pyCAFE's K-means selection captured all major behavioral states (grooming, rearing, locomotion, resting), avoided redundant frames during static periods, and produced training sets rated as "most diverse" compared to uniform or random sampling.

### Comparison with Existing Tools

|Tool|GPU Accelerated|Intelligent Selection|Batch Processing|
|---|---|---|---|
|DeepLabCut Extractor|No|Yes (K-means)|No|
|SLEAP Extractor|No|No (uniform)|Limited|
|FFmpeg|Partial*|No|Yes|
|**pyCAFE**|**Yes**|**Yes**|**Yes**|

*FFmpeg can use GPU decoders but not for clustering.

### Use Cases

pyCAFE is designed for behavioral neuroscience workflows including:

- Extracting training frames for DeepLabCut/SLEAP pose estimation
- Behavioral classification and ethogram development
- Quality control sampling for annotation validation
- Exploratory analysis of long recordings

The software has been successfully used in pilot studies involving mouse social interactions, zebrafish optomotor responses, and rat navigation.

### Future Directions

Planned enhancements include:

- Automatic cluster number selection (elbow method, silhouette analysis)
- ROI-based clustering (focus on animal position, ignore background)
- Alternative clustering methods (DBSCAN, hierarchical)
- Direct DeepLabCut/SLEAP configuration file integration
